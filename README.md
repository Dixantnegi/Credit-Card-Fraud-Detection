# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection
Credit card fraud is a growing concern in the digital economy, leading to billions of dollars in losses annually. Traditional rule-based fraud detection systems often fail to adapt to rapidly evolving fraud tactics. Machine learning provides a more intelligent and adaptive solution by identifying hidden patterns and anomalies in transactions.

Project Objectives:
Enhance fraud detection accuracy using advanced machine learning models.
Reduce false positives to minimize inconvenience for legitimate users.
Enable real-time fraud detection for financial institutions.
Analyze transaction patterns to effectively distinguish between fraudulent and legitimate activities.


Key Features:
Data Preprocessing: Handles missing values, feature scaling, and data balancing to improve model performance.
Machine Learning Models: Implements Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Neural Networks for fraud detection.
Evaluation Metrics: Uses precision, recall, F1-score, and AUC-ROC to assess model effectiveness.
Visualization: Provides insights into fraud patterns through interactive graphs and data analysis.


Dataset:
The project utilizes a publicly available dataset from Kaggle:https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/whenamancodes/fraud-detection. It contains anonymized credit card transactions labeled as fraudulent or non-fraudulent, with transaction details such as amount, type, and timestamps. These features are crucial for training fraud detection models.


Technologies Used:
Python (NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn) for data processing and model development.
Jupyter Notebook for interactive experimentation.
Matplotlib & Seaborn for data visualization and fraud pattern analysis.
